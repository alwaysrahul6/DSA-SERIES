* Q-Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed
* Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days.
*  The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed.
*  Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.
* Examples:
Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.*/
